# Contributing to Private Practice Web Tools

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Private Practice Web Tools! This project aims to help mental health professionals improve their online presence through practical web development tools.

## üéØ Project Vision

We're building tools that make web development accessible to mental health professionals while maintaining high standards for code quality, accessibility, and user experience.

## üöÄ Ways to Contribute

### Code Contributions
- **Bug fixes**: Help identify and fix issues in existing tools
- **Feature enhancements**: Improve existing functionality
- **New tools**: Add new tools that benefit mental health practices
- **Performance improvements**: Optimize loading times and user experience
- **Accessibility improvements**: Ensure tools work for all users

### Non-Code Contributions
- **Documentation**: Improve setup guides, usage examples, and technical documentation
- **Testing**: Test tools with real-world scenarios and report issues
- **Design feedback**: Suggest UI/UX improvements
- **Content review**: Help ensure generated legal content meets professional standards

## üìã Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues**: Look through [open issues](../../issues) to see if your idea is already being discussed
2. **Create an issue**: For significant changes, create an issue to discuss your approach before coding
3. **Review the codebase**: Familiarize yourself with the project structure and coding patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click the "Fork" button on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PrivatePracticeWebTools.git
   cd PrivatePracticeWebTools
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Code Style
- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new files
- **ESLint**: Follow the existing ESLint configuration
- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix for `src/` directory

### Component Guidelines
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Functional component with proper typing
interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  optional?: boolean;
}

export function Component({ title, optional = false }: ComponentProps) {
  // Component logic here
}

// ‚úÖ Good: Use semantic HTML and proper accessibility
<button 
  type="button"
  aria-label="Close dialog"
  onClick={handleClose}
>
  Close
</button>
```

### Accessibility Requirements
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**: All new features must meet accessibility standards
- **Keyboard navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Screen reader support**: Use proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Color contrast**: Maintain minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text

### Testing
- Test components manually in both light and dark themes
- Verify mobile responsiveness on different screen sizes
- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Ensure localStorage persistence works correctly

## üé® Design Guidelines

### UI/UX Principles
- **Professional appearance**: Maintain calm, trustworthy design suitable for mental health context
- **Simplicity**: Keep interfaces clean and uncluttered
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show advanced options only when needed
- **Immediate feedback**: Provide clear success/error states

### Component Usage
- Use existing UI components from `src/components/ui/`
- Follow established patterns for forms, buttons, and layouts
- Maintain consistent spacing using Tailwind CSS classes
